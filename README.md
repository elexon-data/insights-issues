# Insights Solution Issues, Announcements and Live Incidents 

This repository serves as a centralised location for tracking issues and announcements pertaining to the [Insights Solution](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/).

These include any part of Insights Solution:
 - the [Insights website](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/)
 - [Insights Real-Time Information Service (IRIS)](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/iris)
 - the [Insights API](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/api-documentation)

# Announcements and Incidents

Breaking changes to the Insights Solution and planned outages will be announced here.

## 2024-03-25 Breaking change to DISBSAD

We are releasing a breaking change to fix a discrepancy in the DISBSAD data schema between IRIS and the Insights API. IRIS previous returned `IsTendered` as a string with possible values `"Tendered"` or `"Non-tendered"`; after this release it will return a nullable boolean value, where `true` corresponds to `"Tendered"`.

# Issues

Issues should be raised wherever any functionality relating to the services doesn't work as expected; this could also include non-functional aspects e.g. performance. For any feature requests or improvement suggestions, please use the feedback form on the [Insights website](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/).

For any issues with [iris-clients](https://github.com/elexon-data/iris-clients), please raise an issue in that repository.
