# Insights Issues

This repository serves as a centralised location for tracking and managing issues reported on the [Insights Solution](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/).

## What is an issue?

 - [Insights Real-Time Information Service (IRIS)](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/iris)
 - the [Insights API](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/api-documentation)

### Feature requests and improvement suggestions

Issues should be raised wherever any part of these services don't work as expected. For any feature requests or improvement suggestions, please use the feedback form on the [Insights website](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/).

### IRIS Clients

For any issues with [iris-clients](https://github.com/elexon-data/iris-clients), please raise an issue in that repository.
